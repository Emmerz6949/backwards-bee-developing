# Backwards Bee Developing

## Description

This repository was created so I could create my portfolio website using React.js. It features a "Home", "About Me", "My Portfolio", and "Contact Me" page.

You can use the commits to follow my journey.



### How did I do it?

I used JavaScript, JSON, JSX, the React.js framework and its many default dependencies, and the following additional installed via npm Node.js packages: "react-router-dom", and "bootstrap" & its peer dependencies "jquery", "popper.js", & "@popperjs/core" to write my code. I also used an installed via npm Node.js package called "gh-pages" to deploy the website.

### Installation and Usage

There is not anything to install as this is a website that is fully accessible in the browser you are using to access this paage.

To use my portfolio site click on the link in the "How did I do it?" section of this README.md, once the website loads use the navigation bar to peruse the website.
